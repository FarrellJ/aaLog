# TODO List

These are not issues or bugs, just a roadmap for my development.

## Major
No major items at the moment

- [] Complete Splunk Archestra Logs App  

## Minor
- [X] Improve logging for Info and Debug
- [X] Create Splunk Universal Forwarder configuration

## Testing
None planned at the moment


## Other
- [ ] Learn how to use markdown and try to figure out why everyone loves it so much.  HTML with a sprinkle of CSS seemed pretty good for my tastes.  It isn't like we are working over 28.8K modems here.
